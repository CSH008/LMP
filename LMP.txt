for executive registration : 
http://198.27.98.210:8080/lmp/jsp/executive_regis.jsp?name=test&mob=123&email=loaner&pass=welcome123
admin will register executive 1st ... than executive will download the apps and regiuster from mobile 
so if there is no executive entry in DB from admin side .. executive can not registerer
